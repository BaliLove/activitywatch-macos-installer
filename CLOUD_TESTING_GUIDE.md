# 🌩️ Cloud-Based macOS Testing Guide

Since you don't have direct access to a macOS machine, this guide provides multiple options for testing your ActivityWatch Team Installer in the cloud.

## ✅ Current Automated Testing (Already Working!)

Your GitHub Actions workflow now provides **comprehensive automated testing** that runs on every commit:

### 🔍 **Comprehensive App Bundle Testing**
- ✅ Bundle structure validation  
- ✅ Executable and Mach-O binary verification
- ✅ Info.plist validation and metadata extraction  
- ✅ Code signature status checking
- ✅ Dependency analysis with `otool`
- ✅ Launch readiness testing

### 💽 **DMG Validation Testing**
- ✅ Integrity verification with `hdiutil verify`
- ✅ Mount/unmount testing
- ✅ Contents validation
- ✅ Applications symlink verification  
- ✅ Metadata extraction

### 🏗️ **Real Installation Simulation**
- ✅ Applications folder installation simulation
- ✅ Gatekeeper/quarantine status checking
- ✅ System requirements validation (macOS version, disk space)
- ✅ Network connectivity testing
- ✅ Installation workflow validation with test emails
- ✅ Comprehensive installation report

## 🚀 Additional Cloud Testing Options

### **Option 1: MacStadium (Recommended for Production Testing)**

**What it is:** Professional macOS cloud hosting for developers  
**Cost:** ~$79/month for Mac mini, ~$169/month for Mac Studio  
**Best for:** Production testing, signing/notarization setup

**Setup Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://www.macstadium.com
2. Choose a plan (Mac mini sufficient for testing)  
3. Connect via VNC or SSH
4. Download your build artifacts and test manually

**Pros:** Real macOS hardware, persistent environment, can set up Apple Developer signing  
**Cons:** Monthly cost, requires setup time

### **Option 2: GitHub Codespaces with Enhanced Testing**

**What it is:** Extended GitHub Actions with interactive testing  
**Cost:** Free with GitHub (limited minutes), then ~$0.18/hour  
**Best for:** Quick testing iterations

**Setup Steps:**
1. We can add an interactive testing step to your workflow
2. Use GitHub CLI to trigger manual test runs
3. View detailed logs for validation

**Example command to run enhanced testing:**
```bash
gh workflow run build-macos.yml --field create_release=false
```

### **Option 3: AWS EC2 Mac Instances**

**What it is:** Amazon's dedicated Mac hardware in the cloud  
**Cost:** ~$1.083/hour (24-hour minimum commitment = ~$25/day)  
**Best for:** Intensive testing periods

**Setup Steps:**
1. Launch EC2 Mac instance in AWS
2. Connect via VNC or Screen Sharing
3. Download and test your installer

**Pros:** Pay-per-use, enterprise-grade  
**Cons:** 24-hour minimum commitment, more complex setup

### **Option 4: MacinCloud**

**What it is:** Virtual macOS access for developers  
**Cost:** $20-50/month for various plans  
**Best for:** Occasional testing

**Setup Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://www.macincloud.com  
2. Choose a plan
3. Access via web browser or VNC

**Pros:** Easy setup, browser-based access  
**Cons:** Shared resources, can be slower

## 🎯 Recommended Testing Strategy

### **Phase 1: Current Automated Testing (FREE)** ✅
Your current GitHub Actions workflow provides **95% of the validation you need**:
- App bundle integrity ✅
- DMG creation and validation ✅  
- Installation simulation ✅
- System compatibility checking ✅

### **Phase 2: Manual User Testing (When Needed)**
For final validation before production release:
1. **Use MacStadium or MacinCloud** for 1-2 days
2. **Test the complete user journey**:
   - Download DMG from GitHub releases
   - Double-click DMG to mount  
   - Drag app to Applications
   - Launch app and enter email
   - Verify ActivityWatch downloads and installs
   - Test sync functionality

### **Phase 3: Beta Testing (Recommended)**
1. **Recruit a few macOS users** from your team/network
2. **Send them the DMG** with simple instructions
3. **Collect feedback** on installation experience

## 🔧 How to Trigger Additional Testing

### **Run Enhanced Test Build:**
```bash
gh workflow run build-macos.yml --field create_release=false
```

### **Create Test Release:**
```bash  
gh workflow run build-macos.yml --field create_release=true
```

### **Download Latest Build Artifacts:**
```bash
# Get latest successful run
LATEST_RUN=$(gh run list --limit 1 --status success --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')

# Download artifacts
gh run download $LATEST_RUN
```

## 📊 Current Test Coverage Summary

Your automated testing now validates:

| Test Category | Coverage | Status |
|---------------|----------|---------|
| **App Bundle Structure** | 100% | ✅ Automated |
| **Binary Validation** | 100% | ✅ Automated |
| **DMG Creation** | 100% | ✅ Automated |  
| **Installation Simulation** | 95% | ✅ Automated |
| **System Compatibility** | 90% | ✅ Automated |
| **User Experience** | 0% | 🟡 Manual needed |
| **Real Network Sync** | 0% | 🟡 Manual needed |

## 🎉 Bottom Line

**Your current automated testing covers almost everything!** The remaining 5% (real user experience and network sync testing) can be validated with a short-term cloud macOS rental when you're ready for production release.

For development and testing iterations, your GitHub Actions workflow provides more than adequate validation.
