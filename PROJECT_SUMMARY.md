python activitywatch_installer_macos_enhanced.py

# 2. Create GitHub repo and push code
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete macOS installer system"
# Push to GitHub (follow QUICK_START.md)

# 3. Trigger GitHub Actions build
# Go to Actions tab, run "Build ActivityWatch macOS Installer"

# 4. Download and examine artifacts
# You'll get .app bundle and .dmg installer
```

### Step 2: Distribution Testing (30 minutes)
1. **Find a Mac user** on your team
2. **Send them the DMG file** from GitHub artifacts
3. **Have them test installation:**
   - Mount DMG → Run installer → Enter email → Wait
   - Verify ActivityWatch is working at `http://localhost:5600`
   - Check that sync is happening (logs in `~/Library/Application Support/ActivityWatch-Team/logs/`)

### Step 3: Production Setup (Optional - 2 hours)
1. **Get Apple Developer Account** ($99/year)
2. **Add signing secrets** to GitHub repository
3. **Enable signing in workflow** 
4. **Get notarized, trusted installer**
