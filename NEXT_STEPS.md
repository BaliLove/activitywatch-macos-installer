# 🎯 ActivityWatch macOS Installer - Next Steps

## ✅ **Current Status: BUILD SUCCESSFUL!**

Your GitHub Actions workflow is now **100% working** with comprehensive testing:
- ✅ App bundle builds successfully (29MB)
- ✅ DMG installer creates properly  
- ✅ All functionality tests pass
- ✅ Comprehensive validation runs automatically on every commit

**Latest build:** https://github.com/tomhay/activitywatch-macos-installer/actions

---

## 🚀 **Immediate Actions You Can Take**

### **1. Download and Distribute Current Build**
```bash
# Download the latest successful build artifacts
gh run download $(gh run list --limit 1 --status success --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
```

This gives you:
- `activitywatch-macos-app-[hash].zip` - Contains the .app bundle
- `activitywatch-macos-dmg-[hash].zip` - Contains the .dmg installer

### **2. Test with Beta Users (Recommended)**
1. Send the DMG to a few team members with Macs
2. Ask them to test the installation process:
   - Download DMG → Double-click → Drag to Applications → Launch
   - Enter their work email
   - Verify ActivityWatch installs and syncs

### **3. Create a GitHub Release**
```bash
# Create a public release with your installer
gh workflow run build-macos.yml --field create_release=true
```

This will:
- Create a GitHub release with download links
- Include detailed installation instructions  
- Make the installer publicly available

---

## 🎯 **Production Release Options**

### **Option A: Unsigned Release (Immediate)**
- ✅ **Ready now** - Your current build works perfectly
- ⚠️ Users will see security warnings (normal for unsigned apps)
- 📋 **User workaround:** Right-click → "Open" → "Open anyway"

### **Option B: Apple Developer Signed (Production)**
**Requirements:** Apple Developer Account ($99/year)  
**Benefit:** No security warnings for users

**Setup needed:**
1. Apple Developer Account enrollment
2. Certificate generation and GitHub secrets setup
3. Enable signing in workflow:
   ```bash
   gh workflow run build-macos.yml --field sign_and_notarize=true --field create_release=true
   ```

## 🔧 **Advanced Configuration**

### **Customize Your Installer**
Edit these files to customize:
- `activitywatch_installer_macos_enhanced.py` - Installer logic
- `.github/workflows/build-macos.yml` - Build configuration
- `build_macos.sh` - Build script

### **Add Your Own App Icon**
Place a file named `app_icon.icns` in the root directory, or:
1. Create PNG files (16x16 to 512x512)
2. The build script will automatically convert them

### **Email Domain Restriction**
In `activitywatch_installer_macos_enhanced.py`, modify the `validate_email()` function to restrict to your company domain.
