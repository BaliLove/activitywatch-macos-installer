## Troubleshooting

### "App can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"
**Solution**: Right-click the app and select "Open", then click "Open" in the security dialog.

### Installation seems stuck
**Solution**: Check your internet connection. The installer downloads ActivityWatch (~100MB) during installation.

### ActivityWatch doesn't start automatically
**Solution**: 
1. Open ActivityWatch manually from Applications
2. Go to ActivityWatch preferences and enable "Start at login"

### No data appearing in reports

2. Wait 10-15 minutes for the first sync
3. Verify your email was entered correctly during installation
